### 🚘 Driving Change

This is a brief overview of a model for breaking down tasks into achievable steps and collecting the knowledge and resources necessary to accomplish them.

#### 👍 Rules of thumb

- If there are more than two people, teams, or topics that need to be aligned, it may be time for a meeting.
- Only have one topic per meeting. Try to keep the topic small enough so that it can be clearly expressed and responded to in a 30 minute period. This will ensure that all the participants can not only understand the topic to a full degree, they can then easily integrate it with their perspective, and call out discrepencies that may become new requirements.
- It's ok to Have Fun. Raport you build with those you need to cooperate with will mean that everyone will look forward to seeing each other, and building things is not only easy, but fun.

The following three steps run in a loop until none of them produce any new information. Deciding what is relevant and what is too much detail is a challenge here, but because any of the steps identified to reach the goal using this method can themselves be broken down with this method, it would be possible to represent any amount of detail by nesting the process.

## 🌎  1. What is the current state?

- Who are the people involved?
- What time & resource constraints are there?
- Does the current state list enough information to understand the goal?
- Is the current state equal to the goal? (Yay, no more work needed!)

## 🪐  2. What is the goal state?

- Who, what, where, when? Describe state, not the transition.

## 🛸  3. What changes are needed to get there?

- What is missing or extra between the current and goal states?
- What is missing or extra in any of these steps?
- In what order to the tasks associated with this change need to happen?
- What needs to be researched?
